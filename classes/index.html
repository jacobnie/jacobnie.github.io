          <p>I’m a sophomore at Monta Vista High School, and sometimes my friends will come up to me and ask for help on their math homework.  Typically, I show them how to do it, and they thank me, and then they continue with their homework.  More often than not, they come back to me for more help on another problem on the same homework, one that uses the exact same concept, but utilizes a slight twist to make the problem just slightly harder.  And no matter how well they appear to have “understood” the concept, they still can’t get themselves over this slight hurdle.  

What I’m trying to do is illustrate a severe inadequacy with how we teach mathematics.  A teacher can teach one type of problem in class over and over again and put the same problem on the test but with a slight twist, and two thirds of the class won’t know how to solve it.  They take one look at the solution, and they think: how would I have ever thought of that?  Students know how to apply the concepts they learn in class, but they do not know how to solve problems.  

The best way to remedy this issue is by teaching kids how to think from an early age.  Learning how to solve problems requires a solid foundation of arithmetic, and it also requires a certain level of intellectual maturity and a willingness to learn.  For that reason, I will be teaching courses for seventh graders currently taking Algebra 1 and eighth graders taking Geometry.

These courses are not courses for kids already very talented at math. It will be aimed towards students who are looking to increase their mathematical ability.  It’s intended to supplement the school course and dig deeper into the concepts and problems.

The courses will be taught with an emphasis on problem solving.  The concepts will be the same as they are in a school Algebra 1/Geometry course, but the problems will be have a much higher level of difficulty intended to train problem-solving skills.  I believe in the benefits of solving difficult problems.  Spending time on problems you don’t know how to do teaches you more than a teacher can teach you.  It gives you insight and intuition on how to approach even harder problems.  As a teacher, I intend to guide students into a new way of thinking about mathematics.  

Course 1: Algebra 1 — Course 2: Geometry

Grade Level: 7 — Grade Level: 8

Classes: 2 hours once a week, date and time TBD ($30 a week)

Location: Cupertino
If you are interested or have any questions, please email jacobnie2008@gmail.com.  I can only teach the course if there is sufficient interest.  

Here are the topics I will cover in each class, along with course expectations.<br>...</p>
